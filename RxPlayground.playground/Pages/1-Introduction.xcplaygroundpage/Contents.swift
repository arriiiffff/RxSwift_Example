 Subscribing an observable will has 4 condition:
 * **onNext** : When observable is emitting each of its value
 * **onError** : When an error is happen during emitting/subscribing
 * **onCompleted** : When observable is done emitting all its value
 * **onDisposed** : When subscriber is disposed (will be explained more for later)
